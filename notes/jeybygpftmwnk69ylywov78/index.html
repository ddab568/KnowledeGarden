<h2 id="aws-accounts">AWS Accounts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aws-accounts"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>An AWS account is a container for identities (users) and resources</li>
<li>Every AWS account has a root user</li>
<li>The account root user can't be restricted it has full access to everything within this account.</li>
<li>The credit card used with the root account will be the Account Payment method, everything will be billed to that card</li>
<li>AWS is a pay-as-you-go/consume platform</li>
<li>Certain resources have a free-tier</li>
<li>IAM - every AWS account comes with it's own IAM Database</li>
<li>IAM lets you create 3 different IAM profiles - Users, groups and roles
<ul>
<li>Users represent humans or applications that need access to your account - this is for individual purposes</li>
<li>Groups are a collection of related users</li>
<li>Roles can be used for granting external access to your account</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IAM policy - used to allow/deny access to AWS services attached to other identities</li>
<li>IAM is an identity provider, which also authenticates and authorizes</li>
<li>IAM Access Keys are long term credentials with up to 2 available per IAM user typically used in CLIs or applications</li>
<li>Access Keys are made up of Access Key ID and the Secret Access Key</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aws-fundamentals">AWS Fundamentals<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aws-fundamentals"></a></h2>
<h3 id="public-vs-private-services">Public vs Private services<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#public-vs-private-services"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Services can be categorized into two types: public and private services</li>
<li>AWS public and private service are separated by network access.</li>
<li>Public service is something which can be accessed using public endpoints e.g. s3</li>
<li>A private aws service runs within a vpc so only what is connected to that vpc can access it</li>
<li>AWS has three zones - the public internet zone, the private network and the AWS public zone which runs in between the public and private zone.</li>
<li>AWS public zone is where public services operate from e.g. s3</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aws-global-infrastructure">AWS Global Infrastructure<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aws-global-infrastructure"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>AWS have created their infrastructure platform consisting of isolated regions connected together.</li>
<li>A region is a creation of AWS which covers an area over the world which contains a full deployment of AWS infrastructure. New regions are added all the time.</li>
<li>When interacting with most AWS services you're doing it at a particular region e.g. elastic compute cloud in North virginia is different to interacting to elastic compute in Sydney.</li>
<li>AWS also provides Edge locations which are smaller than regions and they typically have only content distribution services as well as some types of edge computing. They are useful for companies like Netflix who want to store tv shows and movies as close to their customers as possible to allow low for low latency and high speed distribution</li>
<li>Some services act from a global perspective e.g. IAM</li>
<li>Regions have three main benefits:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Each reason is separate geographically which isolates any faults</li>
<li>Geopolitical separation - different governance depending the region</li>
<li>Location control - tune architecture performance relative to an area</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Regions also have a code e.g. Sydney is ep-southeast-2, as well as a name - Asia Pacific (Sydney)</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside every region, AWS also provide multiple availability zones. These give isolated infrastructure within a region. If a region experiences an isolated issue but only one availability zone is affected, the others are likely to be still fully functional. A solutions architect may distribute the services across multiple availability zones. This is used to build resilience.</p>
<h3 id="aws-default-virtual-private-cloud-vpc">AWS Default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aws-default-virtual-private-cloud-vpc"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A VPC is a Virtual Network inside AWS</li>
<li>A VPC is a regional service that operates within that region</li>
<li>A VPC by default is private and isolated. Services deployed into the same vpc can communicate but it's isolated from other vpcs and the AWS zone/public internet.</li>
<li>There are two types of VPCs per account:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Default VPCs - can only have one per region. Configured by AWS.</li>
<li>Custom VPCs - can have many per region. You use these in almost all serious AWS deployments to configure them how you like.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>VPCs cannot communicate with each other without you configuring them to do so.</li>
<li>VPCs are regionally resilient</li>
<li>The default VPC gets a default CIDR IP range which is always the same - 172.31.0.0/16</li>
<li>A VPC can be subdivided into subnets for resilience. Each subnet inside a VPC can be put into an availability zone. The default VPC has one subnet in every availability zone in that region.</li>
<li>the default VPC assigns a public address to the services by default.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elastic-compute-cloud-ec2">Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#elastic-compute-cloud-ec2"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>EC2 is a service which allows you to provision virtual machines known as instances with an operating system.</li>
<li>EC2 is IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service) which provides access to virtual machines (instances)</li>
<li>An instance is just an operating system configured in a certain way</li>
<li>EC2 is a private AWS service by default - it uses VPC. You can configure it to have public access</li>
<li>An EC2 is AZ (availability zone) resilient. If the AZ fails then the instance fails</li>
<li>You can choose an instance with various sizes and capabilities</li>
<li>EC2 provides on-demand billing - per second</li>
<li>Instances can use different types of storage e.g. local host storage (ec2 host) or Elastic Block Store (EBS) which is network storage made available</li>
<li>EC2 instances have a state e.g. RUNNING -> STOPPED -> TERMINATED</li>
<li>EC2 can be moved from RUNNING TO STOPPED and back again</li>
<li>TERMINATING an instance is a one way change, you can do that from the RUNNING or STOPPED state. It's a non-reversible action</li>
<li>At a high level, an instance is composed of CPU, memory, disk and networking. You are charged for all four of those instances.</li>
<li>When an instance is STOPPED, it means no CPU, memory or network is being used therefore you won't be charged for any running costs of that instance. Storage however is still being used when it's in the stopped state which means you will be charged for it.</li>
<li>In order to have no costs for an EC2 instance you need to terminate it.</li>
<li>An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an image of an EC2 instance.</li>
<li>An AMI can be used to create an EC2 instance or an AMI can be created from an EC2 instance.</li>
<li>An AMI is similar to a server image in a physical server</li>
<li>An AMI contains:
<ul>
<li>Attached permissions - who can use the image e.g only owner vs specific accounts vs public</li>
<li>Root volume - the drive that boots the operating system</li>
<li>Block device mapping - configuration which links the volumes that the AMI has and how they're presented to the operating system e.g boot vs data volume</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>EC2 can host different OS e.g. linux, windows, macos. You can connect to them via remote desktop (windows) or SSH (linux/macos)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="simple-storage-service-s3">Simple Storage Service (S3)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#simple-storage-service-s3"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>S3 is a global storage platform - it's regionally resilient. The data is replicated across availability zones in that regions. It can tolerate a fault in an AZ</li>
<li>S3 is a public service</li>
<li>It's used to host a large amount of data e.g. movies, audio, photos, text, large data sets</li>
<li>Economical and can be accessed via a variety of methods e.g. UI/CLI/API/HTTP</li>
<li>S3 delivers two main things:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Objects - the data s3 stores</li>
<li>Buckets - containers for objects</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Objects</strong> are basically files that are made up of two components:</p>
<ol>
<li>the object key (name) - usually the file name</li>
<li>the object value (data) - the data or contents of the object</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bucket name needs to be <strong>globally unique</strong> - this is across all regions and aws accounts. It should be between 3-63 characters, all lower case, no underscores. Must start with a lowercase letter or a number. It can't be formatted like an IP address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bucket can hold an unlimited number of objects and an unlimited amount of data - it's an infinitely scalable service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bucket may show on the UI that it has folders but the underlying structure is flat and everything sits in the root. Folders are referred to as prefixes in s3 as they prefix the object names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a soft limit of 100 buckets for an s3 account and a hard limit of 1000 buckets using support request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can have unlimited objects in a bucket, with each object able to range between 0 to 5TB in size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S3 is not a file or block. It is an object store</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can't mount an s3 bucket as a drive e.g. K:\ or /images</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>s3 is great for large scale data storage, distribution or upload</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>great for offloading - moving data from a server to the s3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most services can use s3 as an INPUT or OUTPUT. s3 is a good default for data storage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloudformation-cfn-basics">CloudFormation (CFN) basics<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cloudformation-cfn-basics"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>CloudFormation is Infrastructure as Code (IaC) which allows automation infrastructure creation, update and deletion.</li>
<li>CFN uses templates written in either YAML or JSON</li>
<li>A template:
<ul>
<li>has a list of resources to do the action on (at least one - mandatory)</li>
<li>description - the only restriction with this is if the template has an AWSTemplateFormatVersion, the description must come directly after it (this can be a trick question in the exam)</li>
<li>metadata - controls how the UI presents the template</li>
<li>parameters - adds fields which need to be added with input (default values could be provided)</li>
<li>mappings - allows you to create lookup tables</li>
<li>conditions - decision making in the template</li>
<li>outputs - once the template is finished it can present outputs based on the resource e.g. the instance ID of the ec2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CloudFormation takes a template and creates a stack. A stack contains all the logical resources the template tells it to contain. CFN will create a corresponding physical resource in your AWS account.</li>
<li>You can update or delete the logical resources in the template and the template will do this to the physical resources on your account</li>
<li>CFN exists to automate infrastructure</li>
<li>CFN can be used as part of change management as it can be put in code repositories</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloudwatch-cw-basics">CloudWatch (CW) Basics<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cloudwatch-cw-basics"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>CloudWatch is a support service which is used by many other AWS services. It collects and manages operational data detailing how it performs, runs or logging data</li>
<li>It performs 3 main jobs:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Metrics</strong> - collects metrics from AWS products, Apps, on-premises</li>
<li><strong>Logs</strong> - collects logs as above</li>
<li><strong>Events</strong> - Cloudwatch can generate events to do something</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Namespace is a container for monitoring data. It's a way of separating things into different areas e.g. AWS/EC2</li>
<li>A metric is a collection of related data points in a time ordered structure e.g. cpu utilization, network I/O or disk I/O</li>
<li>Data points are measurements of data consisting of a timestamp and value</li>
<li>Dimensions are used to separate data points within the same metric e.g. instance ID (i-xxxxx) and instance type (t3.small)</li>
<li>We can take action on metrics using alarms</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="shared-responsibility-model">Shared Responsibility Model<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#shared-responsibility-model"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Shared responsibility in AWS is the principal that some areas you have to manage vs AWS have to manage</li>
<li>At a high level, AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud where as customers are responsible for the security in the cloud</li>
<li>AWS responsibilities include managing security of regions, Availability Zones and Edge locations specifically the hardware/global infrastructure.</li>
<li>AWS also manage the security around compute, storage, database and networking as well as any software that is used to provide those services</li>
<li>Customers need to take care of client side data encryption, server side encryption and network traffic protection.</li>
<li>Customers need to take care of OS, network and firewall configuration</li>
<li>Customers need to take care of platform, applications, identity and access management as well as customer data.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/KnowledgeGarden/assets/images/srp-model.png" alt="Shared Responsibility Model"></p>
<h3 id="high-availability-vs-fault-tolerance-vs-disaster-recovery">High-Availability vs Fault-Tolerance vs Disaster Recovery<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#high-availability-vs-fault-tolerance-vs-disaster-recovery"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>High Availability (HA) aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime. for a higher than normal period</li>
<li>HA is about maximizing a system's online time</li>
<li>System availability is usually expressed as a percentage of uptime e.g. 99.9% a year means 8.77 hours p/year downtime</li>
<li>Fault tolerance (FA) is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of one or more of its components</li>
<li>HA is just about maximizing uptime where as FA is operating through failure e.g. a aeroplane can't just be highly available it must be fault tolerant</li>
<li>FA is much more complex and more costly to implement as you need to minimize outages but also design a system that will tolerate a failure</li>
<li>Disaster recovery (DR) is a set of policies, tools and procedures to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and systems following a natural or human-induced disaster</li>
<li>You need to plan what should be done in the event of a failure. An example of DR planning is having off-site backup storage</li>
<li>DR planning should happen in advance so that the process is automated</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>HA - minimise outages</li>
<li>FA - operate through faults</li>
<li>DR - used when these don't work</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="route53-r53-fundamentals">Route53 (R53) Fundamentals<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#route53-r53-fundamentals"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Route53 provides two main services:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Allows you to register domains</li>
<li>Hosts zones on managed nameservers it provides</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Route53 is a global service with a single Database. You don't need to pick a region</li>
<li>It is globally resilient so it can tolerate the fault of multiple regions</li>
<li>Route53 provides DNS zones as well as hosting for those zones</li>
<li>Zone files are created and hosted on four managed name servers</li>
<li>Hosted zones can be public or private (VPC)</li>
<li>A hosted zone hosts DNS records (recordsets)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dns-record-types">DNS Record Types<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#dns-record-types"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are different records that can be stored in DNS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nameserver (NS) - allow delegation to occur end to end in DNS. e.g example.com → ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A and AAAA Records - A record will point to a v4 IP address and the AAAA will point to the v6 IP address. For example:</p>
<p><strong> A Record:</strong> example.com → 192.168.1.1</p>
<p><strong> AAAA Record:</strong> example.com → 2001:db8::1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CNAME - Canonical Name - lets you create the equivalent of DNS shortcuts by pointing to the same A record. E.g. <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> → example.com</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MX Record - how a server can find a mail server for a specific domain. Includes a priority number</p>
<pre><code>example.com
  Priority: 10 → mail1.example.com
  Priority: 20 → mail2.example.com
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>TXT - allow you to add arbitrary text to a domain that must be matched to prove domain ownership.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>TTL (Time To Live) is the time set by the DNS to determine how long a DNS record is cached by a resolver (DNS server o browser) before it must check for an updated record from an authoritative server.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="iam-identity-policies">IAM Identity Policies<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#iam-identity-policies"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IAM policies are a type of policy which get attached to identities in AWS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identities are IAM users, groups and roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM Policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides and denies access to features in AWS</li>
<li>Policy documents are created using JSON containing one or more statements</li>
<li>the first part of a statement is a Sid (Statement ID) which is an optional field that lets you identify a statement and what it does. Using these is best practice to inform the reader</li>
<li>Every statement will have a resource you're interacting with and the action you're wanting to perform on that resource</li>
<li>The action is in the format "service:operation" where the operation can possibly be a wild card or a list of multiple actions</li>
<li>Resources is the same only it matches AWS resources. Individual resources are referred to using the ARN</li>
<li>Effect is either allow or deny. It is possible to be allowed and denied at the same time</li>

<p>Inline policies are when you apply individual JSON policy documents to each individual account. This is good for exceptional or special access rights for an individual as opposed to a group or a number of people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managed policies are another JSON policy that you'd attach to identities in a reusable way. These should be used for the normal default rights in a business as they are low overhead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two types of managed policies: AWS managed policies and customer managed policies which you can create and manage for exact requirements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iam-users-and-arns">IAM Users and ARNs<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#iam-users-and-arns"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>IAM users are an identity used for anything required long term AWS access e.g. humans, applications or service accounts</li>
<li>A principal (a person/application) makes a request to IAM to authenticate to a resource</li>
<li>Authentication for IAM users is done using either username and password or access keys. Access keys are usually used by applications or by humans using CLI tools.</li>
<li>Once a principal goes through the access tools, they become an authenticated identity</li>
<li>Once a principal is identified AWS knows which policies apply to an identity. This is the process of authorization.</li>
<li>Authentication is how a principal can prove to IAM it's who they say they are where as Authorization checks the policies attached to the identity to give them permission for a resource</li>
<li>ARN (Amazon Resource Name) uniquely identify resources within any AWS accounts.</li>
<li>ARN is used to allow you to refer to a single or group of resources using wild cards</li>
<li>ARNs are used in IAM policies</li>
<li>The format is:
<code>arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id</code>
<code>arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id</code>
<code>arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-type:resource-id</code></li>
<li>You can only have 5000 IAM users per account</li>
<li>An IAM User can be a member of 10 groups</li>
<li>If you have more than 5000 identifiable users then IAM users is not the right identity to use for that solution. You can fix this with IAM roles or Identity Federation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iam-groups">IAM Groups<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#iam-groups"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>IAM groups are containers for IAM users</li>
<li>You can't log into IAM groups nor do they have credentials of their own</li>
<li>They are used solely to manage and organise IAM users</li>
<li>an IAM user can be part of multiple IAM groups</li>
<li>Groups can have policies attached to them, both inline and managed</li>
<li>You can also have individual inline/managed policies at the user level</li>
<li>You should collect all the policies that apply to a user from their groups and individual policies and apply the same deny-allow-deny rule to work out what their permissions are</li>
<li>There is no limit for the amount of users in an IAM group but the IAM user limit of 5000 exists for the whole account</li>
<li>There is no such 'all users' group in IAM built in. You can create this and manage it manually</li>
<li>You cannot have any nesting in groups</li>
<li>There is a limit of 300 groups per account but it can be increased with a support ticket</li>
<li>Policies can be attached to resources as well for example a bucket can have a policy attached to it where it allows and denies identities access to that bucket.</li>
<li>A resource can be refer to a user or role to give permission to itself but it cannot give it to a group. This is because a group is not a true identity and they can't be referenced as a principal in a policy</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="iam-roles">IAM Roles<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#iam-roles"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A role is a type of identity that exists inside an IAM account</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM user is when a single principal wants to use AWS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM roles are best suited to be used by multiple principals e.g. multiple users in the aws account or users, apps or services inside or outside of the aws account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you can't identify the number of principals that use an identity or if you have more than 5000 principals you could consider using an IAM role</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually roles are used on a temporary basis to borrow permissions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM roles have two types of policies that can be attached:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trust policy - which identities can assume that role. This can be entities in AWS accounts, other accounts, anonymous users and SSO providers e.g. facebook, google etc</li>
<li>Permissions policy - temporary credentials are given to identities assuming the role and these credentials are used to check the permissions</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>temporary credentials are generated to roles using STS (Secure Token Service).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="when-to-use-iam-roles">When to use IAM Roles<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#when-to-use-iam-roles"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>One of the most common uses of IAM roles is AWS services as they need permission and access rights to perform certain actions</li>
<li>An example is AWS Lambda - it may start/stop ec2 instances, perform backups or other tasks that need permission</li>
<li>Instead of hardcoding the access keys into the Lambda, the IAM role 'Lambda execution role' can grant access to aws product/services. It will use the sts:AssumeRole operation to generate temporary credentials to use AWS services.</li>
<li>This is a better approach than using access keys as it's more secure and it won't need key rotation</li>
<li>Roles are also useful for emergency or unusual situations. A person can assume an emergency role when absolutely required for a short time.</li>
<li>Roles are useful for an existing corporate environment. If a corporate has over 5000 staff you cant assign each of them an IAM user.</li>
<li>You could allow an IAM role inside your AWS account to be used by an external identity e.g. active directory</li>
<li>If you create an app with over 5000 users that needs AWS access, you can use web identity federation which uses IAM roles. Web identities can be providers such as google, facebook or twitter/X</li>
<li>The pro of using web identities is that no AWS credentials are stored on the app and it uses existing accounts that customers have. This can scale to 100 million+ users</li>
<li>If you want to use resources across aws accounts, aws roles can also be used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="service-linked-roles-and-passrole">Service-linked Roles and PassRole<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#service-linked-roles-and-passrole"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Service-linked roles are a special time of IAM role linked to a specific AWS service</li>
<li>their permissions are pre-defined by an AWS service</li>
<li>The main difference between a regular IAM role and a service-linked role is that you cannot delete a service-linked role until it's no longer required</li>
<li>They are either created by a service or by you during set up</li>
<li>Passrole permissions give the users the ability to use a service linked role without being able to create or edit the role. This is similar to using a pre-created role in a cloud formation stack. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aws-organisations">AWS Organisations<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aws-organisations"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>AWS organisations take a single AWS account (standard account) to create an organisation. This account becomes the management account (previously called Master account). </li>
<li>The management account invites existing standard AWS accounts into the organisation. Once they join they change from being standard to member accounts.</li>
<li>An AWS organisation has only ONE management account and zero or more member accounts</li>
<li>An organisational root is not the same as an AWS account root user. The root of an AWS organisation is just a container for aws accounts and organisational units. It's the top level of the hierarchical structure of an organisation. </li>
<li>Consolidating billing for organisations changes the billing methods for member accounts by removing them and passing them through to the management account. In the context of consolidated billing this is known as the Payer Account. </li>
<li>Master, management and payment account refer to the same thing - the account that was used to create the organisation. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="service-control-policies">Service Control Policies<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#service-control-policies"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>SCPs are a feature of AWS organisations which allow restrictions to be placed on member accounts in the form of boundaries</li>
<li>SCPs are policy documents or JSON that can be attached to the organisation as a whole or organisational units or individual AWS accounts</li>
<li>They inherit down the organisation tree so that nested units will be affected by it and everything below it will be affected too</li>
<li>Management accounts are special as they cannot be restricted and not affected by service control policies.</li>
<li>They can limit what a root user can do though</li>
<li>SCP do not grant permissions. They just control what an account can and cannot grant via identity policies</li>
<li>By default, SCP applies FullAWsAccess which means no restrictions </li>
<li>SCP also has implicit deny if there is an absence of an allow</li>
<li>Only permissions allowed within the intersection of Identity policies and SCPs are allowed</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cloudwatch-logs">CloudWatch Logs<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cloudwatch-logs"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A public service that allows you to store, monitor and access logging data</li>
<li>Has built in AWS integration with services eg EC2, VPC, Lambda, CloudTrail, R53</li>
<li>Can generate metrics based on logs (metric filter)</li>
<li>Log events are stored in log streams. Log streams are from one specific source e.g. one ec2 instance</li>
<li>Log groups are containers for multiple log streams for the same type of logging </li>
<li>Log groups are where we define retention and permission policies and metric filters</li>
<li>Metrics can have associated alarms</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cloudtrail-essentials">CloudTrail Essentials<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#cloudtrail-essentials"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A product which logs API calls and account events/activities e.g. creating, deleting s3 bucket, stopping a service etc</li>
<li>A cloudtrail event is a call/activity on an aws account</li>
<li>Stores 90 days of event history - enabled by default for no cost. You don't get any s3 storage unless you configure a trail. </li>
<li>To customise this you must create 1 or more Trails</li>
<li>Management Events and Data Events are the type of trails</li>
<li>Management Events are control plane operations </li>
<li>Data events are resource operations e.g. uploading objects, lambda functions being invoked</li>
<li>By default, cloud trail only logs Management events</li>
<li>A trail logs events for an AWS region it's created in</li>
<li>Cloud trail is a regional service</li>
<li>A trail can be set to all regions or one region </li>
<li>By default, regional trails will log to the region they're in but global services will log to <strong>us-east-1</strong></li>
<li>If you create a trail, it is stored in an s3 bucket as compressed JSON log files</li>
<li>CloudTrail could also be integrated into Cloudwatch logs</li>
<li>You can create an organisational trail which is a single management point for every event across the whole organisation </li>
<li>CloudTrail is NOT real time. There can be a 15+ minute delay</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aws-control-tower">AWS Control Tower<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#aws-control-tower"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>AWS Control Tower gives an easy and quick way to set up a multi-account environment</li>
<li>Control Tower orchestrates other services to provide this functionality e.g. Organizations, IAM identity center, cloudformation, config</li>
<li>It's another evolution of AWS Organisation with more capability </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few different parts of control tower:</p>
<ul>
<li>Landing zone - multi-account environment </li>
<li>Guard Rails - detect/mandates rules and standards across all accounts</li>
<li>Account Factory - automates and standardises new account creation </li>
<li>Dashboard - single page oversight of the entire environment </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Landing Zone</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Home region - the region you deploy the region </li>
<li>brings features of multiple AWS products together e.g. Organizations, AWS Config, Cloudformation</li>
<li>Security OU - organisational unit that has log archive and audit accounts</li>
<li>Sandbox OU - which is for testing and less rigid security</li>
<li>You can create other OU's and Accounts</li>
<li>Utilises the IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) - SSO, multi account, ID Federation </li>
<li>Monitoring and Notifications - cloudwatch and SNS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Guard Rails</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Come in either Mandatory, Strongly Recommended or Elective</li>
<li>Function in two ways</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>preventative - stop you from doing things - either enforced or not enabled</li>
<li>detective - compliance check for identifying issues - either clear, in violation or not enabled </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Account Factory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automate account provisioning</li>
<li>Can be done with cloud admins or end users with appropriate permissions</li>
<li>This provisioning comes with Guardrails which are automatically added</li>
<li>Account admin given to a named user to allow people in the organisation to provision accounts</li>
<li>Accounts are set up with standard configuration</li>
<li>Accounts can be closed or repurposed</li>

<ul>
<li>S3 is private by default </li>
<li>The only identity which has any access to s3 by default is the account root user</li>
<li>You can grant permission to s3 via S3 <strong>Bucket Policies</strong> which are:
<ul>
<li>A form of resource policies</li>
<li>like identity policies but attached to a bucket</li>
<li>From the perspective of the resource  - you control who can access that resource </li>
<li>Identity policies are limited by only being able to give control to the current account, so you cannot give another account access to an s3 bucket. Resource policies allows this for the current or different accounts. </li>
<li>Resource policies can ALLOW/DENY anonymous principals. This can't be done with identity policies since they need to be attached to a valid identity in AWS. Therefore the resource policies can be given to external access.  </li>
<li>Resource policies have a 'principal' component which specifies which principals this policy applies to</li>
<li>An identity policy doesn't have a principal because the policy always applies to the account that created it. A good way to identify identity vs resource policy is checking the absence of principal</li>
<li>Identity policy as well as the bucket policy applies to both internal and cross account access. For anonymous only the bucket policy applies. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Access Control Lists (ACLs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Another form of s3 security used less frequently these days. They aren't recommended any more by AWS</li>
<li>A sub-resource of an object or bucket.</li>
<li>You cannot use ACLs on a group of objects </li>
</ul>
<p>Block Public Access:</p>
<ul>
<li>Another layer of permission to block all public access as a fail safe </li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing between resource or identity policies depends on the business' requirements and personal preference but sometimes choosing one over the other makes sense in specific situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're granting/denying permissions on lots of different resources across an aws account, then you will need to use identity as not all services support resource policies. </li>
<li>If you prefer to manage resources from one place then identity makes sense because this is done in IAM</li>
<li>If you're managing a specific product then resource makes sense</li>
<li>Cross account or anonymous resources should use resource policies</li>
<li>Do not use ACLs unless you MUST  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-static-hosting">S3 Static Hosting<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-static-hosting"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Without static hosting, you access S3 Via AWS APIs</li>
<li>With static hosting, you can access those resources via HTTP e.g. websites, blogs etc </li>
<li>You must set an Index and Error document for s3 hosting. We point the index document to a specific html file object in the bucket as well as Error</li>
<li>A website endpoint is created for hosting</li>
<li>You can use a custom domain via R53 but the bucket name MUST match the domain name</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two scenarios that are perfect for s3</p>
<ol>
<li>Offloading - moving large data from a compute service to s3 is cheaper</li>
<li>Out-of-band pages - if a server is offline for maintenance or has performance bugs we can point users to a static page on s3 that contains something like a status message</li>
</ol>
<p>Pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per GB per month charge</li>
<li>Transfer fee - in is free, out is per gig charge</li>
<li>Request and data retrieval - every operation e.g. GET, POST incurs a cost</li>

<p>Disabled by default. <strong>Once enabled you cannot disable it</strong> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can suspend it and a suspended bucket can be re-enabled
<img src="/KnowledgeGarden/assets/images/s3-versioning-state.png" alt="S3 versioning state"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Versioning let's you store multiple version of objects within a bucket where as without it, there is a unique object name and the object gets replaced each time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the 'id' is null if versioning is disabled, if it is enabled then s3 will allocate an id </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>newer versions will have a new ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The newest version is known as Latest or current version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don't specify to s3 a specific version, you always get the latest. You can access individual versions by specifying the ID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we delete an object, the object is not deleted, it's just hidden and  marked with a delete marker. This is when we don't specify an ID/version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if we specify a version ID then an object is actually deleted </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Important: <strong>versioning CANNOT be switched off - only suspended*</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Space is consumed by ALL versions and you are billed for ALL versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only way to remove all costs is to delete the bucket. Suspending does not remove the old versions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MFA Delete - enabled in versioning configuration which means you need an MFA token to change bucket versioning state or delete version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You would need to pass in MFA and the code passed with API calls to do these actions</p>

<h3 id="s3-performance-optimization">S3 Performance Optimization<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-performance-optimization"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Default upload in s3 is using single data stream to s3. The issue with this is if the stream fails the entire upload fails and you need a full restart</li>
<li>A single PUT upload in AWS is limited to 5GB as a maximum </li>
<li>A solution to a single stream is using a <strong>multi-part upload</strong></li>
<li>This breaks the original blob into individual parts</li>
<li>The <strong>minimum</strong> data size to use multi part upload is 100MB. It's recommended to use it for anything over 100mb. </li>
<li>An upload can be split into a maximum of 10,000 parts with each part between 5mb -> 5gb</li>
<li>Each individual part is treated as it's own isolated upload and can be restarted in isolation </li>
<li>It also improves transfer rates by uploading in parallel </li>
<li>S3 Accelerated transfer 
<ul>
<li>using the public internet is not the most ideal way to get data from source to destination as the route chosen by ISPs is not always optimal. S3 transfer acceleration uses the network of AWS Edge locations located in convenient areas. This feature needs to be switched on. </li>

<li>
<p>Handles both Symmetric and Asymmetric keys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capable of performing cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrypt)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keys never leave KMS</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uses a FIPS 140-2 (L2) - the L2 matters for the exam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS Keys are the keys that KMS manages </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are logical containers which contain ID, date, policy, desc and state. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS keys are backed by physical key material</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The material is generated or imported and can be used for up to 4kb of data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS Keys do not leave the KMS product and the unencrypted form is never stored on disk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) are another type of key in KMS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEK uses GenerateDataKey which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data more than 4kb in size</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS does NOT store DEK, it provides it to you and discards it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS will provide you with the plaintext and ciphertext version of this key</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS does not do the encryption or decryption using DEK - you do or the service using KMS does</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services such as s3 use DEK for every object</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS keys are isolated to a region and never leave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS keys CAN be multi region</p>

<li>
<p>THere are two types of customer owned keys:</p>
<ol>
<li>AWS managed - created automatically by services</li>
<li>Customer managed - created by customers and are more configurable</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both of these keys support rotation - with AWS managed keys this cannot be disabled but with customer it is optional</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A KMS key contains a backing key which means previous backing keys can be used </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can use alias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every KMS Key has a key policy (resource). For customer managed keys you can change it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KMS has to be explicitly be told which AWS account to manage it</p>

<h3 id="s3-object-encryption-csesse">S3 Object Encryption CSE/SSE<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-object-encryption-csesse"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Buckets aren't encrypted - objects are</li>
</ul>
<p>Data can be stored in disk in two different ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client side encryption - objects are being encrypted by the client before they ever leave. AWS receives it in a scrambled form and stores it in a scrambled form</li>
<li>Server side encryption - in transit, the data is in it's original form, once it's hitting s3 it's encrypted by the s3 servers </li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/KnowledgeGarden/assets/images/s3-encryption.png" alt="S3 Encryption"></p>
<p>There are 3 types of encryption for server side encryption:</p>
<ol>
<li>SSE-C - Server side encryption with customer provided keys </li>
<li>SSE-S3 - with amazon s3 managed keys (this is the default)</li>
<li>SSE-KMS - with KMS Keys stored in AWS Key management service </li>
</ol>
<p>SSE-C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer is responsible for the keys and S3 manages the s3 encryption/decryption processes. When you put an object into s3 you put it through as plaintext alongside the encryption key. When it goes through https it will be encrypted to an external observer. The key is destroyed at s3. </li>
</ul>
<p>SSE-S3: </p>
<ul>
<li>AWS handles both the encryption and the keys. You provide the plaintext data, the s3 encrypts it via a generated key for the object. You don't get to choose the key or customise it. </li>
</ul>
<p>SSE-KMS:</p>
<ul>
<li>You use KMS to create a key. Client sends data via plaintext and it's encrypted by S3 via the KMS key. That key is used by s3 to generate an encryption Key. Using this method, key managers can decide who can see the unencrypted data </li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A way to help s3 scale with server side encryption</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using SSE-KMS, AWS KMS is called every single time a call is made to s3 to generate a DEK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This starts to cost a lot upon scaling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of generating a new DEK from KMS every time, <strong>bucket keys</strong> will ask KMS to generate a time limited bucket key used to generate DEKs within s3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This significantly reduces KMS API calls, reduces cost and increases scalability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using bucket keys means cloudtrail kms events now show the bucket not te object</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bucket key works with replication, object encryption is maintained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you replicate a plain text bucket to a bucket that is encrypted, it will get encrypted at the destination side  </p>

<p>S3 standard should be used for frequently accessed data which is important and non-replaceable. This should be used as the default and only investigate moving other classes if you need a specific use case. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>S3 Standard-IA (infrequent Access)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same as S3 standard in most ways however has a lower GB storage price and a retrieval fee that increases with frequent data access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is a minimum duration charge for using it (30 days)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has a min capacity charge of 128kb per object</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>S3 Standard-ia should be used for long-lived data which is important but where access is infrequent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>S3 One Zone-IA (infrequent Access)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shares many of the considerations of standard-IA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The big difference is that the data is stored in one AZ in the region </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should be used for long-lived data which is non-critical and replaceable and where access is infrequent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples could be intermediate data you can afford to use or for replica copies</p>

<p><strong>S3 Glacier - Instant</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like s3 standard IA except it has cheaper storage, more expensive retrieval costs, and longer minimums</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more for when you want to access something once a quarter as opposed to once a month </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>S3 Glacier - Flexible</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A cheaper storage solution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stored as if 'cold' and therefore cannot be made publicly accessible. Retrieving requires a retrieval process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retrieved to s3 standard-IA temporarily</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are 3 different retrieval methods:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>expedited - 1-5 minutes</li>
<li>standard - 3-5 hours</li>
<li>bulk - 5-12 hours</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the faster the retrieval the more expensive</li>
<li>situations for when you need to store archival data where frequent or realtime access isn't needed (e.g. yearly) and the access takes time. </li>
<li><strong>S3 Glacier - Deep Archive</strong></li>
<li>If you consider Flexible to be a 'chilled' state, then data in Deep Archive is in a 'frozen' state </li>
<li>180 day minimum duration</li>
<li>The retrieval methods are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>standard (12 hours)</li>
<li>bulk (up to 48 hours)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>best for data that rarely if ever needs to be accessed e.g. legal or regulation data storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it's a cheaper storage</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent Tiering</strong>
Monitors and automatically moves any objects not accessed for 30 days to a low cost infrequent access tier and eventually to archive instant access, archive access or deep archive tiers. If objects start to become more popular and frequently accessed, they will be moved back up the tiers to frequent access at no charge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designed for long lived data with changing or unknown patterns</p>
<h3 id="s3-lifecycle-configuration">S3 Lifecycle Configuration<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-lifecycle-configuration"></a></h3>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can create life cycle rules on objects in an s3 bucket </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A set of rules that consist of actions based on a criteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be applied on a bucket or group of objects</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>two types of actions can be applied</p>
<ul>
<li>Transition actions - change the storage class of the object(s) e.g. from s3 standard to s3 IA after 30 days
<ul>
<li>all the transitions transition 'downward' in a waterfall fashion, not upward</li>
<li>the only exception of a transition not available downward is one zone-IA into S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval </li>
<li>if you transition objects you need to be aware of the minimum days before transition for example s3 standard to standard IA or one zone IA it would need to have been in s3 standard for at least 30 days</li>
<li>smaller objects can cost more upon transitioning due to minimum sizes</li>
<li>moving from s3 to IA also requires an additional 30 days before you can move them again to glacier classes </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expiration actions - delete object(s) or versions</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't apply these rules based on 'access frequency' in the same way intelligent tiering does</p>
<h3 id="s3-replication">S3 Replication<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-replication"></a></h3>
<p>S3 has two replication features which allow objects to be replicated between source and destination buckets in the same or different AWS accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cross region replication (CRR) - allows the replication of objects from a source bucket to one or more destination buckets in different AWS regions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Same region replication (SSR) - as above but same region</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The architecture replication is applied to the source bucket. It specifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>the destination bucket</li>
<li>an IAM role to use for the replication process - s3 assumes that role</li>
<li>For replication across AWS accounts, the role isn't by default trusted by the destination account, therefore there needs to be a bucket policy in the destination account to allow the role to replicate into it </li>
</ul>
<p>Replication Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>What to replicate - all objects or subset</li>
<li>which storage class the destination bucket will use - the default is the destination uses the same class as the source</li>
<li>you can define the ownership of the objects in the destination. Across accounts, the bucket objects will by default be owned by the source bucket account</li>
<li>Replication time control (RTC) - adds a guaranteed 15 minute SLA on to the replication process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Replication consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, it's not retroactive - only from the point you enable replication will objects in the bucket be replicated. Objects prior to that time will not. </li>
<li>Versioning MUST be enabled for replication</li>
<li>batch replication can be turned on to replicate existing objects</li>
<li>objects are replicated only one way i.e. source to destination - there is a bi-directional setting that can be configured</li>
<li>replication can be unencrypted, SSE-S3, SSE-KMS (with extra config) and SSE-C</li>
<li>Source bucket owner needs permission to the object they replicate</li>
<li>It will not replicate system events that are made by life cycle management. Neither can it replicate glacier or glacier deep archive objects</li>
<li>Delete markers are not replicated - but can be enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>Why use replication?</p>
<ul>
<li>SSR (Same region replication) - Log aggregation - sync logs into a single s3 bucket</li>
<li>SSR - Prod and test sync</li>
<li>SSR - resilience with strict sovereignty </li>
<li>CRR (Cross region replication) - global resilience improvements</li>
<li>CRR - Latency reduction by replicating data to buckets closer to source</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-presigned-urls">S3 PreSigned URLs<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-presigned-urls"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Presigned URLS in s3 are a way to generate a URL with access permissions in a safe way. </li>
<li>If a bucket is not public, only an authenticated aws user can access it</li>
<li>AWS offers pre-signed urls for the case where we don't want to give someone short term access to the bucket without making it public or creating an aws identity for them </li>
<li>This can be used for both PUT and GET operations</li>
<li>Pre-signed urls allow someone to access a certain object in a private bucket with the same access rights as the user who generated the url for a certain period of time</li>
<li>You can create a pre-signed url for an object you don't have access to where the url will also not provide access to the object </li>
<li>the url has the same permissions of the identity as of the time the url was made</li>
<li>Don't generate pre-signed urls with a role - URLs will stop working when temporary credentials expire - because assuming an IAM role gives you temporary credentials and the pre-signed url may expire far later than the credentials. It's best to use long term identities i.e. an IAM user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-select-and-glacier-select">S3 Select and Glacier Select<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-select-and-glacier-select"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Ways you can retrieve parts of objects rather than all of an object</li>
<li>S3 can store objects up to 5TB in size</li>
<li>Retrieving a whole object will take time</li>
<li>S3/Glacier select lets you use SQL like statements to select part of an object</li>
<li>Works on many file types such as CSV, JSON, Parquet, BZIP2 compression for CSV and JSON</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-events">S3 Events<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-events"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to create event notifications on a bucket</li>
<li>When enabled, a notification is delivered when something happens on a bucket. It can be delivered to SNS, SQS and lambda functions</li>
<li>Can be generated when objects are created (PUT, POST, COPY and Multi part upload)</li>
<li>Can be generated on Delete (as well as delete markers)</li>
<li>For object restores (start and end)</li>
<li>Replication events</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-access-logs">S3 Access Logs<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-access-logs"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. They are best effort - they are usually logged in target bucket within a few hours </li>
<li>Let you help the access patterns of your customer base</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-object-lock">S3 Object Lock<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-object-lock"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Enable on new S3 buckets only otherwise you will need to contact AWS for an existing</li>
<li>You cannot disable object lock or versioning </li>
<li>Write Once Read Many (WORM) - No delete, no overwrite</li>
<li>Requires versioning to be enabled and individual versions are locked</li>
<li>An object version can have one, both or none of <strong>retention period</strong> or <strong>legal hold</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Retention Locking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specified in days and years</li>
<li>The two types you can do:
<ol>
<li>Compliance mode - an object version can't be adjusted, deleted or overwritten for that period. The retention period and mode cannot be changed even by the account root user. This is the most strict form of object lock. This could be good for compliance reasons e.g. medical or legal </li>
<li>Governance - can grant special permissions to allow locking settings to be adjusted (s3:ByPassGovernanceRetention). Useful if you want to prevent accidental deletions</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Legal Hold Locking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set on object version either on or off, no retention period</li>
<li>You can't delete or change until removed</li>
<li>You need permission to add or remove the legal hold</li>
<li>Good to prevent accidental deletion of critical object versions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s3-access-points">S3 Access Points<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#s3-access-points"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A feature of S3 which improves the manageability of s3 buckets</li>
<li>Rather than having 1 bucket with 1 bucket policy you can conceptually split it into many access points with different policies</li>
<li>Each access point can be limited in terms of where they can be accessed from with it's own endpoint address</li>
<li>Can be created via the console of via the cli: <code>aws s3control create-access-point --name secretcats --account-id 12355423 --bucket catpics</code></li>
<li>You can think of access points as mini buckets or views. The DNS of each AP is given to a section of users and those mini buckets are individually controlled</li>
<li>Any definitions defined in the access point policy need to be defined in the bucket policy e.g. giving permission to certain users for the access point </li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A private network inside AWS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to decide what IP range to use in advance - it's not easy to change later. There are a few things you should keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>What size should the VPC be? This influences how many services can fit into the VPC</li>
<li>Are there any networks we can't use? Duplicate or overlapping ranges complicate things</li>
<li>Be mindful of other VPC ranges, other cloud envs, on premises, partners and vendors and their IP ranges</li>
<li>Try to plan for the future</li>
<li>Consider the VPC structure - tiers and resiliency </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A VPC can be at the smallest a /28 network (16 IP) and at most /16 (65536 IPs)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid common ranges </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ranges can be determined by the number of regions a business operates in. A suggestion is to reserve 2+ networks per region being used per account
e.g. 3 US, Europe, Australia - 5 regions x 2 - Assume 4 accounts - total 40 ranges ideally </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deciding what size VPC to get, you should ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many subnets will you need in each VPC?</li>
<li>How many IP Addresses will you need in total ad how many per subnet?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services use subnets and subnets operate in 1 availability zone. THerefore you need to consider regions as some regions have more availability zones than others.</p>
<ol>
<li>pick how many AZs yours would use - possibly use 4 as a default. This means you need 4 smaller networks </li>
<li>A suggested default is to start with four tiers - Web, application, database and a spare. If you only used 1 az then you would each tier would need it's own subnet so 4 subnets</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="custom-vpcs">Custom VPCs<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#custom-vpcs"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>VPCs are a regionally isolated and regionally resilient service</li>
<li>Lets you create an isolated network in AWS</li>
<li>Nothing is allowed IN or OUT without explicit configuration</li>
<li>Flexible configuration </li>
<li>Hybrid networking </li>
<li>You have the option of created default or dedicated tenancy - allows you to either put the VPC in shared or dedicated hardware - If you put default you can change this later. If you put dedicated <strong>it's locked in and any resources on this vpc will have to be dedicated too</strong>. Only choose this if you really need it as it comes at a premium cost </li>
<li>Can use IPv4 private and public IPs</li>
<li>Private CIDR block is the main method of communication for the VPC</li>
<li>This primary block at it's smallest can be /28 (16 IP) and max /16 (65,536 IP)</li>
<li>You can create optional secondary IPv4 block</li>
<li>Can be configured to use IPv6 (/56). However, you can't pick a range, AWS chooses them for you unless you own specific IPv6 IPS</li>
</ul>
<p>DNS in a VPC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provided by R53</li>
<li>Available on the base IP address of the VPC +2</li>
<li>enableDnsHostnames - gives public DNS hostnames to instances</li>
<li>enableDnsSupport - enables DNS resolution in VPC - if not then the dns won't work </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vpc-subnets">VPC Subnets<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vpc-subnets"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Subnets in VPCs start of entirely private and you need to configure them to be public </li>
<li>A subnet is an AZ resilient feature of the VPC</li>
<li>It's a subnetwork of a VPC within a particular AZ</li>
<li>1 subnet is created a specific AZ in that region. It can never be changed and can never ben in multiple AZs. ONE SUBNET => ONE AZ. Although one AZ can have 0 or more subnets</li>
<li>Allocated an IPv4 CIDR - it has to be within the range of the VPC</li>
<li>The CIDR that a subnet uses can't overlap with other subnets in that VPC</li>
<li>Can optionally be allocated an IPv6 CIDR block. A /64 subset of the /56 is allocated (256)</li>
<li>Subnets can communicate with other subnets in the VPC</li>
<li>Sizes of networks are based on the prefix</li>
<li>Some IPs in every VPC network are reserved</li>
</ul>
<p>Every VPC subnet has five addresses that cannot be used. Assuming the subnet we use is 10.16.16.0/20, the following can't be used:</p>
<ol>
<li>the network address (starting address) e.g. 10.16.16.0</li>
<li>Network + 1 (10.16.16.1) - used by the VPC router </li>
<li>Network + 2 (10.16.16.2) - Reserved by the DNS </li>
<li>Network + 3 (10.16.16.3) - For future use</li>
<li>Broadcast address 10.16.31.255 (Last IP in subnet)</li>
</ol>
<p>A VPC has a configuration object applied to it called a DHCP option set - (dynamic host configuration protocol) - how computing devices receive IP addresses automatically. </p>
<ul>
<li>On every subnet you can define two important allocation options:
<ol>
<li>Auto assign public IPv4 - allocated public addresses as well as their private automatically</li>
<li>Auto assign public IPv6 </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vpc-routing-internet-gateway--bastion-hosts">VPC Routing, Internet Gateway &#x26; Bastion Hosts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#vpc-routing-internet-gateway--bastion-hosts"></a></h3>
<p>VPC Router:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every VPC has a VPC router - it's highly available</li>
<li>In every subnet, the network+1 address is reserved for the vpc router</li>
<li>It routes traffic between subnets</li>
<li>It's controllable, you create route tables which influences what to do with traffic when it leaves the subnet </li>
<li>A VPC is created with a main route table - if you don't explicitly associate it, then it uses the main route table of the vpc. Otherwise if you create your own, the old one is dissociated. A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time but a route table can be associated with many subnets</li>
<li>A route table is a list of routes - the vpc looks at the destination address, looks at the route table for the destination address and propagates the data to those destinations. It can be either to a single route or a range. The prefix is used as a priority - the higher the prefix the higher the priority </li>
<li>The target field in a route table is either pointing to a gateway or to local </li>
<li>All route tables have at least 1 route - the local route which matches the VPC CIDR range</li>
<li>If it's also ipv6 enabled it will have another default local route for ipv6</li>
<li>These local routes can never be updated, and those two will ALWAYS take priority</li>
</ul>
<p>Internet Gateway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regional resilient gateway which can be attached to a VPC </li>
<li>you do not need a gateway per availability zone</li>
<li>a vpc can have no internet gateways or just one</li>
<li>a gateway can have no attachments or 1 at a time </li>
<li>Runs from the border of the VPC and the aws public zone - allows services to be reached from the internet (AWS public zone)</li>
<li>it's a managed gateway, aws handles the performance</li>
<li>Public ipv4 internet addresses never actually touch the services inside the VPC. A record is created which the internet gateway maintains. The instance itself is not configured with a public IP. </li>
</ul>
<p>baston Host / Jump boxes</p>
<ul>
<li>An instance in a public subnet inside a vpc </li>
<li>used to manage incoming connections</li>
<li>this allows you to access internal vpc resource - it's a management or entry point to private vpcs</li>
<li>It used to be the only way in to a vpc </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stateful-vs-stateless-firewalls">Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#stateful-vs-stateless-firewalls"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>TCP and IP work together where TCP connection send IP packets</li>
<li>TCP runs on top of IP</li>
<li>A stateless firewall does not understand the state of connections. It needs two rules per inbound connection, an inbound and an outbound and 2 per outbound connection (inbound and outbound). </li>
<li>You will have to allow the full range of ephemeral ports allowed in stateless firewall since responding to a request in a stateless server goes back to a random requester port. This can be a security concern. </li>
<li>A stateful firewall is intelligent enough to identify the request and response components of a connection</li>
<li>you will only have to allow the request meaning the response is automatically allowed </li>
<li>You don't need to allow the full ephemeral port range because a stateful firewall is smart enough to know which port to open up for a request/response </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="network-access-control-lists-nacls">Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#network-access-control-lists-nacls"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be thought of as a traditional firewall available in AWS vps </li>
<li>Connections within a subnet are not affected by NACLs but inbound/outbound crossing the subnet boundary are filtered by NACLs</li>
<li>NACLs have inbound and outbound rules - data entering and leaving the subnet. Remember a request and a response can be both inbound and outbound. </li>
<li>A VPC is created with a default NACL. Inbound/outbound rules have the implicit deny (*) and an ALLOW ALL rule. The result is all traffic is allowed, the NACL has no effect </li>
<li>Custom NACLs are created for a specific VPC and are initially associated with no subnets. The default rule for inbound and outbound is an implicit deny (*). This means all traffic is denied by default</li>
<li>NACL crossing subnets needs the correct inbound/outbound rules</li>
<li>NACLs can only be assigned to subnets in AWS</li>
<li>They can be used together with security groups to add explicit DENY</li>
<li>Each subnet can have one NACL associated to it (default or custom)</li>
<li>A single NACL can be associated with many subnets</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-groups-sg">Security Groups (SG)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#security-groups-sg"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A second type of security filtering feature used in AWS VPC</li>
<li>SG's are stateful - they detect response traffic automatically for a given request</li>
<li>that means any IN or OUT request that is allowed will automatically allow a response - you don't have to worry about configuring ephemeral ports </li>
<li>The major limitation of SG's are that there is no EXPLICIT deny. You cannot block specific bad actors e.g. a range of or a single  IP</li>
<li>Usually SGs and NACLs are used in conjunction for this reason</li>
<li>SG support iP/CIDR AND logical resources</li>
<li>This includes other security groups as well as itself</li>
<li>SGs are not attached to instances nor subnets, they are attached to specific elastic network interfaces known as ENIs</li>
<li>SG can use logical references - it can refer to other security groups so that you don't explicitly put IP ranges, any resource in that SG is allowed </li>

<h3 id="network-address-translation-nat--nat-gateway">Network Address Translation (NAT) &#x26; NAT Gateway<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#network-address-translation-nat--nat-gateway"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A set of different processes by changing their source/destination IP addresses </li>
<li>IP Masquerading is a subset of NAT. IT can hide CIDR IP Blocks behind one IP i.e. many private IP to one public IP</li>
<li>Since IPv4 addresses are running out, giving many private CIDR range <strong>outgoing</strong> internet access </li>
<li>A NAT gateway takes all the incoming packets from all the instances it's managing and it records all the information about the communication. It takes those packets, changes the source address from those instances to it's own IP address (external facing address). </li>
<li>NAT Gateways need to be run from a public subnet so that you can assign an external IPv4 for it </li>
<li>Uses Elastic IPs (static ipv4 public)</li>
<li>AZ resilient service - to make it region resilient, you should but a nat gateway in each AZ and a routing table for each AZ in that NAT gateway as a target</li>
<li>Can get costly if you have a lot of AZs</li>
<li>They are a managed service, you deploy and AWS takes care of them </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/KnowledgeGarden/./assets/images/natgw-resilience.png" alt="NATGW Full resilience"></p>
<ul>
<li>A NAT instance is when you make an EC2 instance run as a NAT instance </li>
<li>It's much easier and scalable to use a NAT gateway except for when:
<ul>
<li>cost is an issue</li>
<li>for test purposes </li>
<li>need something free tier eligible </li>
<li>you need to connect to them like normal ec2 instances - NAT Gateway cannot be used as a bastion host nor can they do port forwarding </li>
<li>NAT Gateways don't support security groups, they can only use NACLs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>NAT is not required for IPv6</li>
<li>In AWS IPv6 addresses are all publicly routable</li>
<li><strong>Nat gateways DON'T work with IPV6</strong></li>
<li>if you add ::/0 route, that will give an internet gateway bidirectional connectivity for ipv6</li>
<li>You can use Egress Only internet gateway if you want outbound only connection for IPv6</li>

<ul>
<li>EC2 provides virtualisation as a service (IaaS)</li>
<li>Virtualization is the process of running more than one operating system on a piece of physical hardware (a server)</li>
<li>Before virtualization, Applications would run on top of an OS in user mode. They cannot directly access hardware resources. If apps try to do that it would cause a system wide error or crash the application</li>
<li>Virtualization fixes this by allowing a single piece of hardware to run multiple OS' where each is separate.</li>
<li>Historically, virtualization was done in two ways:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Emulated Virtualization (software) - the OS still ran on the hardware on top of a hypervisor. The software ran in privileged mode. Each OS ran inside in a virtual machines. They have emulated hardware provided by the hypervisor. The main issue was that this method was slow. </li>
<li>Para-virtualization - only works on a small subset of OS that can be modified. </li>
</ol>
<p>The major improvement in virtualization came when the physical hardware became virtualization aware. This is known as hardware assisted virtualization. The CPU itself knowns virtualization exists. The hardware redirects privileged calls to the hypervisor.
The process of where the hardware devices themselves become virtualization aware is known as SR-IOV - single route I/O virtualization. Allows a network card or any other I/O card to present itself as not a single card but as several mini cards. These are presented to the guest operating system as real cards and hence the hypervisor doesn't need to be used - the OS can directly use it's card when it wants. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>EC2 instances are virtual machines (OS + Resources)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run on EC2 Hosts which are either shared or dedicated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared hosts are used by different AWS customers so you don't get ownership of hardware and you pay for usage and resource. There is still no visibility between customers when using shared hosts. Shared host is the default type of hosting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dedicated hosts is dedicated to your account and you pay for the whole thing. You don't share it with any AWS customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EC2 is an <strong>AZ resilient service</strong> - Hosts run in a single AZ. If that AZ fails then hosts will fail and any instances on those hosts will fail or be impacted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EC2 have some local hardware: cpu, memory and storage (instance store). The instance store will be lost if the instance moves to another host. They also have storage and data networking. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EC2 can connect to network storage known as Elastic Block Store (EBS). EBS also rus inside an AZ. You can't access it cross zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an availability zone in AWS has issues, it impacts ec2, subnets, storage and volumes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An instance runs in a specific host and it will stay on that host when you restart it. It stays there unless it fails or is taken down by AWS. Also if it is stopped and started which is different to restarting. In that instance it will be relocated to another host but it will still be in the same AZ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can never connect network interfaces or EBS storage in one AZ to an ec2 instance in another AZ</p>
<p>EC2 is good when:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have a traditional OS and compute need</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long running compute needs as it's designed for persistent long running compute requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have server style applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For burst or steady state load</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For monolithic application stacks </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For migrating application workloads or disaster recovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EC2 tends to be the default compute service in AWS unless you have niche requirements. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ec2-instance-types">EC2 Instance Types<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ec2-instance-types"></a></h3>
<p>Factors in choosing instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU, memory, local storage capacity and type will influence which instance type you choose</li>
<li>Resource ratios can give you different ratios of different o resource which will also affect your decision</li>
<li>The amount of storage, data and network bandwidth </li>
<li>The architecture and vendor the instance is run on - x86, ARM, intel, AMD </li>
<li>Additional features and capabilities - GPUs, FPGAs </li>
</ul>
<p>EC2 instances are grouped into 5 main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>General Purpose - default - should be first choice. even resource ratio, diverse workloads</li>
<li>Compute Optimized - Media Processing, High performance computing, scientific modelling, gaming, machine learning. Ratio is higher towards CPU</li>
<li>Memory Optimized - inverse of compute - ideal for applications for processing large in-memory datasets, database workloads</li>
<li>Accelerated computing - for additional capabilities e.g. hardware GPUs field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)</li>
<li>Storage Optimized - fast local storage needs - sequential and random IO. Data warehouses, elastic search, data analytics </li>
</ol>
<p>Decoding EC2 Types:
Example: "R5dn.8xlarge"</p>
<ul>
<li>Letter at the start is the instance family - specific type/types of computing </li>
<li>Next (5) is the generation e.g. 5th generation of the family. The latest generation should ideally always be used</li>
<li>the part of the dot - the size "8xlarge" - the instance size</li>
<li>the "dn" - additional capability e.g n could mean network optimized </li>

<h3 id="storage-refresher">Storage Refresher<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#storage-refresher"></a></h3>
<p>Storage terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct (local) attached storage - Storage on the EC2 Host. Fast but prone to loss</li>
<li>Network attached storage - volumes delivered over the network (EBS). Resilient but slower</li>
<li>Ephemeral Storage - temporary storage</li>
<li>Persistent Storage - Permanent storage - lives on past the lifetime of the instance</li>
</ul>
<p>Three main categories of storage available in AWS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Block storage - Create a volume that has addressable blocks. No structure provided. The OS usually takes the block storage and creates a file storage on it. Can be HDD or SSD or a logical storage that's backed by physical storage. You can mount and boot off this volume. </li>
<li>File storage - presented as a file server with a structure already there. Mountable but not bootable since the OS doesn't have low level access to it. </li>
<li>Object storage - Flat collection of objects. Not mountable or bootable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Storage Performance terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>I/O (block) size - the size of the blocks of data that you're writing to disk - KB/MB. </li>
<li>IOPS - input output operations per second - how many reads/writes a disk or storage system can accommodate in a second </li>
<li>Throughput - amount of data that can be transferred per second - MB/s. Relies on using the right block size and then maximising the number of IOPS</li>
</ul>
<p>IO X IOPS = THROUGHPUT</p>
<h3 id="elastic-block-store-ebs-service-architecture">Elastic Block Store (EBS) Service Architecture<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#elastic-block-store-ebs-service-architecture"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Provides block storage which can be addressed using block IDs. It takes raw physical discs, and presents a raw allocation of those disks known as volumes. These volumes can be written to or read from using a block number. They can be encrypted</li>
<li>When you attach a volume to an EC2 they see a block device and they can use it to create a file system on top of it (ext3/4, xfs). They appear just like any other storage design</li>
<li>Storage is provisioned in ONE AZ. It is separate and isolated within that AZ. </li>
<li>You can attach to one EC2 instance (or other service) over a storage network. There is a multi attach feature which allows to attach to multiple at a time but it needs to be managed so that there aren't multi writes</li>
<li>You can de-attach and reattach the EBS to another volume. EBS are persistent so if an instance moves or stops, restarts, the EBS is maintained</li>
<li>Snapshots can be taken of EBS volumes and they can be regionally resilient by migrating them between AZs and regions </li>
<li>EBS can provision different physical storage types, sizes and performance profiles</li>
<li>You are billed based on GB-month (and sometimes performance)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can't communicate across AZs for EBS</p>

</ul>
<p><img src="/KnowledgeGarden/./assets//images/instance-store-volumes.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<ul>
<li>if you move an instance between hosts, that data is lost. They are given new ephemeral volumes. </li>

<ul>
<li>Persistence required - default to EBS (avoid Instance store)</li>
<li>Resilience - as above</li>
<li>If you need storage isolated from instance lifecycles then use EBS</li>
<li>If your instance requires resilience but your app supports built-in replication, you could use lots of instances </li>
<li>If you need high performance - both could be good although super high performance, instance store makes more sense</li>
<li>If cost is a concern, instance store makes sense as it comes with the instance</li>
</ul>
<p>REMEMBER these figures: </p>
<ul>
<li>If you need cheap storage but with EBS, use ST1 or SC1 because they are cheaper</li>
<li>Throughput or streaming should default to DT1</li>
<li>if you need a boot volume NEITHER ST1 OR SC1 are suitable</li>
<li>GP/2 - can deliver up to 16,000 IOPS </li>
<li>IO1/2 - up to 64,000 IOPS (*256,000 for block express for large instance types)</li>
<li>RAID0 + EBS can achieve 260,000 IOPS (io1/2-BE/GP2/3 combination)</li>
<li>If you need more than 260,000 and you can deal with less resilience or no persistence, then use Instance Store </li>

<li>Protect against AZ issues, migrate data between AZs</li>
<li>Snapshots become region resilient </li>
<li>Incremental in nature - the first is a full copy of the data on the volume</li>
<li>Future snapshots only store the difference - consume less space and are quicker to perform</li>
<li>If you accidentally delete a snapshot, future snapshots will fix any lost saves</li>
<li>EBS volumes can be blank or based on a restored snapshot </li>

<li>Snaps restore lazily - fetched gradually</li>
<li>Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR) is an option to immediately restore</li>
<li>Up to 50 FSR snaps per region can be restored. Set on the Snap and AZ. </li>
<li>FSR costs extra and can get expensive</li>
<li>You can achieve the same end result by manually getting the OS to read all the data in s3 which forces the requested blocks to be pulled in </li>

<li>Will charge up to your maximum price before terminating any of your instances</li>
<li>Never use SPOT for workloads which can't tolerate interruptions</li>
<li>Good fits for SPOT workloads are things that are not time critical or can tolerate interruption/re-run e.g. media processing</li>

<li>You can commit for 1 year of 3 years - the longer the more discounted but you need to be careful of wasted resource</li>
<li>You can choose to pay no upfront - per second fee </li>
<li>You can choose upfront means no per second fee so you get the greatest discount here</li>
<li>Partial upfront - pay a smaller lump sum in advance for a lower per-second cost</li>
</ul>
<p>Dedicated host:</p>
<ul>
<li>An EC2 host that is dedicated to you in it's entirety </li>
<li>You pay for the host - the instances on the host you don't pay for so they can be any size up until the capacity</li>
<li>You have a feature called host affinity - stopping and starting instances means that they can stay on the same host</li>
<li>A good use case for dedicated host is you are using software that has licensing based on socket and core</li>
</ul>
<p>Dedicated Instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>A middle ground - instances run on ec2 hosts with other instances of yours and no other customers use the same hardware. You don't pay for the host nor share. You don't to manage the host itself </li>
<li>You have to pay one off hourly fee for any regions where you use them</li>

<li>Capacity reservations
<ul>
<li>have a requirement for some compute that you can guarantee you can launch when you need</li>
<li>You can purchase a reservation and make it a regional one, you get billing discounts on instances in the AZ. They don't reserve capacity within an AZ which is risky during major faults when capacity can be limited</li>
<li>You can pick a zonal reservation - only apply to one AZ providing billing discounts and capacity reservation in that AZ</li>
<li>Regional/AZ are both 1 or 3 year commitment - you can choose on demand capacity reservation  - can be booked to ensure you always have access to capacity in an AZ when you need it but at full on demand price. You will pay regardless of whether you consume it </li>

<ul>
<li>Two different ways to handle increasing and decreasing load on the system</li>
</ul>
<p>Vertical scaling: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use a bigger server e.g. using a different ec2 instance i.e. go from t3.large to t3.xlarge</li>
<li>There will be downtime when you do this - you should do it during an outage window </li>
<li>Larger instance carry a price premium </li>
<li>there is an upper cap on the performance of an instance</li>
<li>No application modification required</li>
<li>works for all applications even monolithic </li>
</ul>
<p>Horizontal scaling:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of increasing the size of an individual instance, you add more instances with load</li>
<li>Instead of one running copy of your application you will have multiple that need to work together</li>
<li>For that reason you will need a load balancer usually so that the load is distributed across the instances</li>
<li>Sessions handling is important - since you may be shifting between instances constantly - you would need application support or <strong>off-host sessions</strong> which means that the session is stored somewhere else e.g. another db</li>
<li>Using off-host sessions would mean the application is stateless - the application doesn't care which instance you connect to </li>
<li>You have no disruption while you're scaling - customer connections remain unaffected and if the sessions are externally hosted it wouldn't matter if you scale down either</li>
<li>There are no real limits to horizontal scaling </li>
<li>Often less expensive - no large instance premium </li>
<li>more granular in terms of resource management </li>

<h3 id="introduction-to-containers">Introduction to Containers<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#introduction-to-containers"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A container is similar to a VM in that in provides an isolated environment </li>
<li>Where virtual machines run a whole isolated OS, a container runs as a process within the host operating system </li>
<li>The processes are like isolated OS</li>
<li>Containers are much lighter than virtual machines since they don't need to run a full OS</li>
<li>A container is a running copy of a docker image</li>
<li>Docker images are a stack of layers created using a docker file</li>
<li>Docker images are how we create a docker container - a running copy of a docker image</li>
<li>A container registry is a hub of container images - it can be private or public e.g. docker hub</li>
</ul>
<p>Container key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dockerfiles are used to build images</li>
<li>Containers are portable, self contained and always run as expected</li>
<li>Containers and images are super lightweight</li>
<li>Containers only run the application and environment it needs</li>
<li>Provide much of the isolation VMs do</li>
<li>Ports are 'exposed' to the host and beyond</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ecs---concepts">ECS - Concepts<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ecs---concepts"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ECS is a product that allows you to run containers fully or partially managed by AWS - it takes away much of the admin overhead of managing containers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ECS to containers is what ec2 is to virtual machines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ECS uses clusters which runs in two modes: ec2 mode which uses ec2 instances as container hosts or fargate mode which is a serverless way of running docker containers </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ECS lets you create a cluster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AWS also have a container registry called ECR (elastic container registry)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task in ECS represents the container as a whole </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task role is the IAM role a task can assume to interact with AWS resources - a task role is the best way to give permission to containers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tasks and containers are separate things. A task can include one or more containers. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A service definition is how we can define a task to scale and how we want it to run </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A container definition - defines the image and ports that will be used for a container - points to a container image in a registry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task definition applies to the application as a whole. It can be a single container definition or multiple containers and multiple container definitions. It's also where you define a task role and the resources that your task is going to consume</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A task role is the IAM role which hte task assumes </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service - how many copies of a task you want to run, High availability, restarts </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ecs---cluster-mode">ECS - Cluster Mode<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#ecs---cluster-mode"></a></h3>
<p>EC2 cluster types defines a number of things but one of them is how much admin overhead surrounding running a set of container hosts that you manage vs how many AWS manage. </p>
<p>EC2 Mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with an ECS management component (also exists in fargate) - handle high level tasks</li>
<li>An ECS cluster is created within VPC in your AWS account  - benefits from the multiple AZs</li>
<li>EC2s are used to run containers</li>
<li>Auto scaling groups are used </li>
<li>If you want to use containers in your infrastructure but you want to also manage host capacity and availability then EC2 mode is the appropriate choice</li>
<li>With EC2 mode, even if you're not running any tasks or services in your containers, you will still be paying for them while they're running</li>
</ul>
<p>Fargate mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>removes more overhead </li>
<li>you have no servers to manage - you won't have to pay for EC2 instances</li>
<li>AWS have a shared fargate infrastructure</li>
<li>Fargate still operates in VPC and across AZ</li>
<li>Tasks and services run on the shared infrastructure platform and are then injected into your VPC - they're given network interfaces inside the VPC</li>
<li>You only pay for the containers you are using based on the resources they consume - you don't need to manage or provision hosts</li>
</ul>
<p>EC2 vs ECS (EC2) vs Fargate:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you use containers, use ECS over EC2</li>
<li>Pick EC2 mode when you have a large workload and price conscious organisation - you can use reserved pricing and try to optimise </li>
<li>Large workload but overhead conscious - use fargate </li>
<li>Small or burst style workloads - fargate makes sense as you only use for the resources the container uses</li>
<li>batch/periodic workloads - fargate</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elastic-container-registry-ecr">Elastic Container Registry (ECR)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#elastic-container-registry-ecr"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>ECR is a managed container image registry service - like docker hub but for AWS</li>
<li>We have public and private registries - each aws is provided with one of each. </li>
<li>Each registry can have many repositories (think of github)</li>
<li>Inside each repo you can have many container images and these can have several tags. </li>
<li>The tags need to be unique within your repository</li>
<li>public registry means that anyone can have read only access to anything within that repo (read write needs permission)</li>
<li>private registry means permission required for read only OR read write</li>
<li>ECR is integrated with IAM for permission</li>
<li>Image scanning is either in basic or enhanced (using inspector product)</li>
<li>ECR provides near real time metrics - delivered into cloud watch (auth, push, pull)</li>
<li>ECR logs all api actions into cloud trail</li>
<li>Generates events that are pushed to eventbridge</li>
<li>offers replication cross region and cross-account</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="kubernetes-101">Kubernetes 101<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#kubernetes-101"></a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Open source container orchestration system - use it to automate the deployment, scaling and management of containerised applications</li>
<li>A cloud agnostic product so you can use it on many cloud platforms </li>
<li>A kubernetes cluster is a highly available cluster of compute resources which are organised to work as one unit</li>
<li>The cluster starts with a cluster control plane - it manages the cluster, scheduling, applications, deploying</li>
<li>Cluster nodes are VM or Physical servers which function as a worker in the cluster - they run the containerized applications</li>
<li>containerd or docker is the software for handling container operations </li>
<li>kubelet is the agent to interact with the cluster control plane </li>
<li>kubelet interacts with the control plane using kubernetes API </li>
<li>Pods are the smallest unit of computing in kubernetes. It's common to see one container one pod architecture </li>
<li>You could run multiple containers in a pod but it's usually when they're tightly coupled and are in close proximity </li>
<li>You will rarely manage pods directly - they are temporary</li>
<li>kube-api server is the front end for kubernetes control plane</li>
<li>etcd provides a highly available key-value store - main backing store</li>
<li>kube-scheduler - responsible for checking pods that don't have a node assigned - will assign based on constraints</li>
<li>optional component - cloud-controlled-manager - provides cloud specific control logic i.e. AWS/azure/GCP </li>
<li>kube controller manager - cluster controller processing - node controller, job controller, endpoint controller, service account &#x26; token controllers</li>
<li>on every node - kube proxy is a network proxy - it coordinates networking with the control plane </li>
</ul>
<p>summary terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>cluster</strong> deployment of kubernetes</li>
<li><strong>node</strong> - resources: pods are placed on nodes</li>
<li><strong>pods</strong> - smallest unit in kubernetes - often 1 container 1 pod </li>
<li><strong>services</strong> - an abstraction from pods - service running on 1 or more pods</li>
<li><strong>job</strong> - ad-hoc, creates one or more pods until completion</li>
<li><strong>ingress</strong> - exposes a way into a service </li>
<li><strong>ingress controller</strong> - used to provide ingress e.g. AWS LB controller</li>
<li><strong>Persistent storage (PV)</strong> - provision long running storage to your applications</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elastic-kubernetes-service-eks-101">Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) 101<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#elastic-kubernetes-service-eks-101"></a></h3>

categorized into two types: public and private services\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAWS public and private service are separated by network access.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePublic service is something which can be accessed using public endpoints e.g. s3\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA private aws service runs within a vpc so only what is connected to that vpc can access it\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAWS has three zones - the public internet zone, the private network and the AWS public zone which runs in between the public and private zone.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAWS public zone is where public services operate from e.g. s3\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"aws-global-infrastructure\"\u003eAWS Global Infrastructure\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aws-global-infrastructure\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAWS have created their infrastructure platform consisting of isolated regions connected together.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA region is a creation of AWS which covers an area over the world which contains a full deployment of AWS infrastructure. New regions are added all the time.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen interacting with most AWS services you're doing it at a particular region e.g. elastic compute cloud in North virginia is different to interacting to elastic compute in Sydney.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAWS also provides Edge locations which are smaller than regions and they typically have only content distribution services as well as some types of edge computing. They are useful for companies like Netflix who want to store tv shows and movies as close to their customers as possible to allow low for low latency and high speed distribution\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSome services act from a global perspective e.g. IAM\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRegions have three main benefits:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEach reason is separate geographically which isolates any faults\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGeopolitical separation - different governance depending the region\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLocation control - tune architecture performance relative to an area\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRegions also have a code e.g. Sydney is ep-southeast-2, as well as a name - Asia Pacific (Sydney)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInside every region, AWS also provide multiple availability zones. These give isolated infrastructure within a region. If a region experiences an isolated issue but only one availability zone is affected, the others are likely to be still fully functional. A solutions architect may distribute the services across multiple availability zones. This is used to build resilience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"aws-default-virtual-private-cloud-vpc\"\u003eAWS Default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aws-default-virtual-private-cloud-vpc\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA VPC is a Virtual Network inside AWS\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA VPC is a regional service that operates within that region\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA VPC by default is private and isolated. Services deployed into the same vpc can communicate but it's isolated from other vpcs and the AWS zone/public internet.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are two types of VPCs per account:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDefault VPCs - can only have one per region. Configured by AWS.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCustom VPCs - can have many per region. You use these in almost all serious AWS deployments to configure them how you like.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVPCs cannot communicate with each other without you configuring them to do so.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVPCs are regionally resilient\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe default VPC gets a default CIDR IP range which is always the same - 172.31.0.0/16\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA VPC can be subdivided into subnets for resilience. Each subnet inside a VPC can be put into an availability zone. The default VPC has one subnet in every availability zone in that region.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ethe default VPC assigns a public address to the services by default.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"elastic-compute-cloud-ec2\"\u003eElastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#elastic-compute-cloud-ec2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEC2 is a service which allows you to provision virtual machines known as instances with an operating system.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEC2 is IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service) which provides access to virtual machines (instances)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn instance is just an operating system configured in a certain way\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEC2 is a private AWS service by default - it uses VPC. You can configure it to have public access\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn EC2 is AZ (availability zone) resilient. If the AZ fails then the instance fails\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou can choose an instance with various sizes and capabilities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEC2 provides on-demand billing - per second\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInstances can use different types of storage e.g. local host storage (ec2 host) or Elastic Block Store (EBS) which is network storage made available\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEC2 instances have a state e.g. RUNNING -\u003e STOPPED -\u003e TERMINATED\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEC2 can be moved from RUNNING TO STOPPED and back again\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTERMINATING an instance is a one way change, you can do that from the RUNNING or STOPPED state. It's a non-reversible action\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt a high level, an instance is composed of CPU, memory, disk and networking. You are charged for all four of those instances.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen an instance is STOPPED, it means no CPU, memory or network is being used therefore you won't be charged for any running costs of that instance. Storage however is still being used when it's in the stopped state which means you will be charged for it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn order to have no costs for an EC2 instance you need to terminate it.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an image of an EC2 instance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn AMI can be used to create an EC2 instance or an AMI can be created from an EC2 instance.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn AMI is similar to a server image in a physical server\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAn AMI contains:\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAttached permissions - who can use the image e.g only owner vs specific accounts vs public\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRoot volume - the drive that boots the operating system\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBlock device mapping - configuration which links the volumes that the AMI has and how they're presented to the operating system e.g boot vs data volume\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEC2 can host different OS e.g. linux, windows, macos.

These are presented to the guest operating system as real cards and hence the hypervisor doesn't need to be used - the OS can directly use it's card when it wants. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ec2-architecture-and-resilience\"\u003eEC2 Architecture and Resilience\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#ec2-architecture-and-resilience\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEC2 instances are virtual machines (OS + Resources)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRun on EC2 Hosts which are either shared or dedicated\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShared hosts are used by different AWS customers so you don't get ownership of hardware and you pay for usage and resource.
